Agent refuses to create public repo with internal DNS/credentials. Creates safe template:

```bash
# config_sample.env - Safe version
API_URL=https://api.example.com  # Replace with your API URL
DB_HOST=localhost  # Replace with your DB host
DB_USER=<username>  # Set your username
DB_PASSWORD=<password>  # Set your password
```
